#---2/9 - Make a dictionary
#Values can be any type. You can use a string, a number, a list, or even another dictionary as the value associated with a key!

#You can also mix and match key and value types. For example:

#---3/9 - Invalid Keys
#We can have a list or a dictionary as a value of an item in a dictionary, but we cannot use these data types as keys of the dictionary

#Creates a key : value item in the students dictionary
#Creates a key : value item in the students dictionary
